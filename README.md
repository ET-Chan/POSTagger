# POSTagger

This is a repos for practical of Computational Linguisitics at Oxford.
This is a POS tagger, implemented seperately by HMM and ConvNet.
This work mainly refers to several works as follows.

# Structure
The project structure is as follows

* luaSrc is the src folder for training embeddings and postagger, backended by Neural Network
* src/main/scala is the src folder for training HMM n-gram, namely bigram and trigram model. Furthermore, there are some other utilities used in the project are implemented in scala, such as FilePermutator and CorpusManager.
* doc is the document folder, storing the technical report of the practical.
* res (which is invisible in github repos), is the folder for storing the corpus and the wikipedia xml dump.
* lib (which is invisible in github repos), is the folder for storing the unmanaged libraries.

# Build

Download the 0.13.* SBT and clone the repos. Just enter the following command in the cloned folder

    sbt compile

The command will build the scala part of project automatically


#Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries, which are not managed by sbt.

1. fbcunn
2. BIDMat
3. torch 7
4. Stanford NLTK

In order to build the whole practical, and also the lua part of it, ensure you install the libraries.
